## Learning ObjectivesðŸ’¡

What i learned from this project:

- How to manipulate bits and use bitwise operators
- Look for the right source of information without too much help


## Tasks

## 0. 0
- A function that converts a binary number to an unsigned int.
## 1. 1
- A function that prints the binary representation of a number.
## 2. 10
- A function that returns the value of a bit at a given index.
## 3. 11
- A function that sets the value of a bit to 1 at a given index.
## 4. 100
- A function that sets the value of a bit to 0 at a given index.
## 5. 101
- A function that returns the number of bits you would need to flip to get from one number to another.
## 6. Endianness
-  A function that checks the endianness.
