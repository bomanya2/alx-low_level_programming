## 2. Assembler
- Script that generates the assembly code of a C code and save it in an output file.
## 3. Name
- Script that compiles a C file and creates an executable named cisfun.
## 4. Hello, puts
- C program that prints exactly "Programming is like building a multilingual puzzle, followed by a new line.
## 5. Hello, printf
- C program that prints exactly with proper grammar, but the outcome is a piece of art,, followed by a new line.
## 6. Size is not grandeur, and territory does not make a nation
-  C program that prints the size of various types on the computer it is compiled and run on.
## 7. What happens when you type gcc main.c
- Blog post that explains all the steps of compilation. Use command lines and examples to illustrate.
## 8. Intel
- Script that generates the assembly code (Intel syntax) of a C code and save it in an output file.
## 9. UNIX is basically a simple operating system, but you have to be a genius to understand the simplicity
